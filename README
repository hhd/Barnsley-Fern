The Barnsley Fern is a fractal named after the British mathematician
Michael Barnsley. The fern is a basic example of a mathematically
generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction.

This program will generate the fractal in a GUI window.

I have written this using the Viewport graphics library available in
PLT Scheme (or Racket these days). I recommend installing Dr. Scheme (sudo apt-get install drscheme)
and selecting the "Pretty Big" implementation.

  (load "/path/to/this/repo/fern.scm")
  (draw-fern)

Change the WIDTH, HEIGHT and ITERATIONS values to suit.


TODO
  - Allow for gradients in the image (is that even possible?)
  - Add constants for generating different types of fern
